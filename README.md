# WebAssembly

This section presents development approaches for [WebAssembly (Wasm)](https://webassembly.org/) that relates to its use in server environments. This is not Wasm's original focus. But Wasm offers the basics of being able to run on different systems without the need for changes. This means that it is not necessary to write different code for different platforms or architectures. This simplifies development and deployment and saves time and resources. This perspective is elaborated here.
